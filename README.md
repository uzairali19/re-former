# Re-Former

> This is an example of a CRUD app using rails forms. The main features of the app is that all the functions work dynamically using forms. A user is able to create, edit, delete or view a user. Since it is to test backend logic styling is not the main emphasis of this project. Please follow the steps to get your local copy and play around. Happy Coding!!!
